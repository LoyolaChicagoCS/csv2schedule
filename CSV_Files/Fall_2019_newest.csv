This section of COMP 453 will use Python to access a MySQL database both locally and remotely.  The Flask web development framework is used.  We will
incorporate both standard SQL queries as well as SQLAlchemy as an object-relational mapping (ORM) tool.  A complete website with user account support and
"CRUD capabilities is developed.  Python will also be used to introduce MongoDB for data cleaning and querying, using the MongoDB Aggregation Framework as"
"well as the MongoDB query language.  We will use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive testing, MongoDB Atlas as a cloud-based host, and Compass as a local GUI."
